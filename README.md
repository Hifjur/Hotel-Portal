# Hotel Reservation Portal

The hotel reservation system will be a website for travelers to book hotels ahead of time. The main purpose of this project is to is make reservations easier for the traveler in a new area they are traveling to. It is going to be a web-based system made with Javascript. We will use a Javascript framework instead of plain javascript for this project. The tools used will be ReactJS as the front end and Express.JS a Node.JS framework as the backend. We will use MongoDB as our NoSQL database. Firebase will be used for the authentication process to implement a secure user experience. The full project will be available via Github and we plan to host the front-end application on Firebase and host the backend at Heroku. The website will have several features:

- Users will be able to make reservations after the login. Hotels will be available to be looked at even if the user is not logged in.
- Users can cancel reservations from the dashboard if needed.
- There will be a login system and it will have two categories, one for customer/user and another one for admin.
- Admins will be presented with a similar-looking but different functionality-based UI so they can manage the website from UI.
- Admin can see reservations from everyone and manage the reservation like cancellation and confirmation from their end if a user is having trouble managing their reservation.
- Users will only see their own reservation and have options like payment and status of the reservation.
- Admin can add new hotel reservations to the system and remove or update old ones right from the UI.
- Users will be able to search for hotels by using keywords like price, location, and names.
- Users can make payments from the dashboard.

These will be the main features that we will be focusing on. There might be some small changes to make some slice-of-life improvements to the website to enhance the user experience. Our goal is to make the website as user-friendly as possible. That also comes will some challenges. We need to make sure that the website is responsive so it grants a seamless experience transitioning from computer to mobile device. Implementing a payment gateway is always a challenge. We are planning to go with stripe because it is widely accepted worldwide. We will be making the website with fake hotels data. So we need to make sure we do not use any copyright materials. In that case, it sometimes becomes really difficult to find the right images to make the website look good and professional.
